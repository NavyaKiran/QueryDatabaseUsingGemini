This is a small project showing the power of Google Gemini. Here, natural language prompts are converted into queries (SQL). 
I have created an example database "STUDENT" with a few rows. Queries can be written against this database. 
The Gemini AI converts natural language prompts such as "How many students are present" into an SQL query. This generated SQL query is then run against the database.
A streamlit app has been used as the front end interface.
